# Caesar Cipher Text Encryption and Decryption Tool

## Overview
This is a simple Python program that implements the **Caesar cipher** algorithm for encrypting and decrypting text. The Caesar cipher is a basic encryption technique where each letter in the plaintext is shifted a certain number of places down or up the alphabet.

## Features
- Encrypts text using a specified shift value.
- Decrypts text back to its original form using the same shift value.
- Handles both uppercase and lowercase letters, leaving non-alphabetical characters unchanged.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
Ensure you have Python installed on your machine.

### Usage
1. Clone this repository to your local machine:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/YourUsername/caesar-cipher.git
# ceaser_cipher.py
Example
Input Message: HEY
Shift Value: 5
Encrypted Message: MJ3
Decrypted Message: HEY
How It Works
The program uses a simple algorithm to shift each letter by the specified number of places.
It ensures that the shifts wrap around the alphabet, meaning after 'Z' it goes back to 'A', and similarly for lowercase letters.
